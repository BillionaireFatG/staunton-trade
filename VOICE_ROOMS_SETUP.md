## 📦 Installation Steps

### Step 1: Install Agora SDK

```bash
cd staunton-frontend
npm install agora-rtc-react agora-rtc-sdk-ng
```

### Step 2: Get Agora Credentials

1. Go to [Agora.io](https://www.agora.io/)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Create a new project
4. Get your **App ID** from the project dashboard

### Step 3: Add Environment Variables

Add to your `.env.local`:

```bash
# Agora Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_AGORA_APP_ID=your-agora-app-id-here
```

### Step 4: Run Database Migration

In Supabase Dashboard:
1. Go to **SQL Editor**
2. Run `supabase/migrations/005_voice_rooms.sql`
3. Verify tables created:
   - `voice_rooms`
   - `voice_participants`

### Step 5: Enable Realtime

In Supabase Dashboard:
1. Go to **Database** → **Replication**
2. Enable replication for:
   - `voice_participants` table

### Step 6: Update Agora Client (Optional - for production)

Once Agora SDK is installed, update `lib/agora/client.ts` to uncomment the actual implementation.

### Real-time Features

## 🔧 How It Works

### Without Agora (Current State)

The system is fully functional for:
- Browsing voice rooms
- Joining/leaving rooms
- Seeing who's in each room
- Real-time participant updates
- UI/UX for voice controls

**What's missing:** Actual voice audio

### With Agora (Production)

Once Agora SDK is installed:
1. User clicks "Join Room"
2. System requests microphone permission
3. Agora client connects to channel
4. Audio streams between participants
5. Speaking detection updates UI
6. Mute/unmute controls actual audio

## 🎯 Usage Flow

### Joining a Room

```
User browses rooms → Clicks "Join Room" → 
Microphone permission requested → 
Agora connects → User added to participants → 
Voice controls appear → Audio streaming begins
```

### Leaving a Room

```
User clicks "Leave Room" → Confirmation dialog → 
Agora disconnects → User removed from participants → 
Voice controls hidden → Back to browsing
```

## 🔐 Security

- **RLS Policies:** All tables protected
- **Authentication:** Required for all voice operations
- **Microphone Permission:** Browser-level security
- **Token-based:** Agora tokens for production (optional)

## 📱 Mobile Responsiveness

The system is designed to work on mobile:
- Simplified participant grid (1 column)
- Floating voice controls (fixed bottom)
- Touch-friendly buttons
- Responsive layout

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

When in a voice room:
- **M** - Toggle mute
- **L** - Leave room
- **⌘K** (or Ctrl+K) - Open global search
- **ESC** - Close search modal
- **↑/↓** - Navigate search results
- **Enter** - Select search result

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### Professional B2B Design
- Monochrome theme (respects user's theme choice)
- Green for active/speaking
- Red for muted/destructive actions
- Subtle animations (150-300ms)
- No excessive emojis (only in room names)

### Performance
- Lazy loading for heavy components
- Efficient Realtime subscriptions
- Debounced UI updates
- Optimized re-renders

### Accessibility
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Clear visual indicators
- Screen reader support (via shadcn/ui)
- High contrast for verification badges

## 🚀 Next Steps

### For MVP (Without Agora)
The system is **ready to use** for:
- Team coordination
- Deal discussions
- Seeing who's online
- Building community

### For Production (With Agora)
1. Install Agora SDK (see Step 1)
2. Get Agora App ID (see Step 2)
3. Add environment variable (see Step 3)
4. Update `lib/agora/client.ts` with actual implementation
5. Test microphone permissions
6. Test audio streaming
7. Implement token-based authentication (optional, for security)

## 📊 Database Schema

### voice_rooms
```sql
- id (UUID, primary key)
- name (TEXT)
- category (TEXT) - 'fuel', 'metals', 'agriculture', 'logistics', 'general'
- emoji (TEXT)
- agora_channel_name (TEXT, unique)
- description (TEXT, nullable)
- is_public (BOOLEAN, default true)
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)
```

### voice_participants
```sql
- id (UUID, primary key)
- room_id (UUID, foreign key → voice_rooms)
- user_id (UUID, foreign key → profiles)
- is_muted (BOOLEAN, default false)
- is_speaking (BOOLEAN, default false)
- joined_at (TIMESTAMP)
- UNIQUE(room_id, user_id)
```

## 🔗 Integration Points

### With Existing Systems
- **Auth:** Uses existing `AuthProvider`
- **Profiles:** Integrates with profile system (roles, verification)
- **Messaging:** "Send DM" button links to existing chat
- **Theme:** Respects user's theme preferences
- **Navigation:** Added to sidebar, accessible from top bar

### API Endpoints
All operations use Supabase client-side SDK:
- `getVoiceRooms()` - List all rooms
- `getRoomParticipants()` - Get participants in a room
- `joinRoom()` - Join a room
- `leaveRoom()` - Leave a room
- `updateMuteStatus()` - Toggle mute
- `subscribeToRoom()` - Real-time updates

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No rooms available"
- Run the database migration
- Check Supabase connection
- Verify `voice_rooms` table exists

### "Failed to join room"
- Check user is authenticated
- Verify RLS policies are correct
- Check browser console for errors

### "Microphone permission denied"
- Browser blocked microphone access
- Check browser settings
- Try HTTPS (required for microphone)

### Real-time not working
- Enable Realtime for `voice_participants` table
- Check Supabase Realtime status
- Verify WebSocket connection in Network tab
